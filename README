This is a simple demo program for doing genotyping, methylation calling and haplotyping.

The project should be located in the same directory containing sonLib (https://github.com/benedictpaten/sonLib), which must be installed.
Given this requirement a simple 'make all' should be enough to build the project. 'make test' will then do a batch of obligatory tests.


TODOs:

Features:
- add in genotype functions / and code to spit out genotypes / best guess haplotypes
- add code to break up haplotypes where less certain
- add interface code

Organization:
- Documentation / readme

Optimization:
- investigate more effective pruning in the cross product function using the probabilities
    DO PRUNING IN CROSS PRODUCT FUNCTION?
- add iterative refinement step
